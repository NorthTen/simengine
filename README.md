# simengine
This project is a simulation engine.

# About
This project is simply about creating a simulation engine from gathered experience from what I have learned and seen thus far, but made in my own way.

This is not a "game" engine, it's more proper name is simulation engine, which is why it is named such, and is called such.
However, you can create a "game" using my simulation engine.


# Goal(s)
- Available to use for low-spec computers.

This project is ultimately going to consist of ideas, and what could be made better scenarios but written into this project.
So it's partially about creativity, and improvement.
